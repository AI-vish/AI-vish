# About Me

I am currently focused on enhancing my skills in Machine Learning and Data Structures & Algorithms. I am eager to collaborate on AI and ML projects, and I am particularly interested in deepening my understanding of Deep Learning algorithms. My learning journey currently includes Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss ML algorithms, HTML, CSS, or Linear Algebra.

Fun fact: I do Calisthenics.
